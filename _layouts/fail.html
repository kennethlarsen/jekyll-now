  <p>What is this you might think? This page is for everyone who feels like they are not good enough. Imposter Syndrome is a huge problem in the development community. I've been working as a developer for ~7 years and I've contributed to a lot of great open source projects - but guess what? I make stupid mistakes every single day. This is a log of (almost) all of my mistakes. Hopefully, they will make you feel better.</p>
 <p>If you think this is an interesting idea then check out my <a href="https://tinyletter.com/failmail" target="_blank">newsletter on the subject of failing as a developer.</a></p>
